The Senate voted on DeVos""?highly contentious nomination this afternoon, and the tally was split evenly, requiring Pence to use his authority as president of the upper chamber of Congress to break the impasse. This was the first time that a vice president has broken a tie to confirm a Cabinet nominee. Pence read the vote count 50-50 and then voted himself, rendering the tally 51-50. The day before the vote, Democrats staged a 24-hour marathon of speeches, with more than 30 lawmakers taking to the floor to urge at least one additional Republican to vote against DeVos and block her confirmation. ""It is hard to imagine a worse choice,""?Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., said before she read letters from constituents urging her to vote no. DeVos stirred up vehement opposition from teachers""?unions and all 48 Senate Democrats. Many cited concerns about her support of school vouchers, which critics believe will weaken public schools, and her lack of experience, since she never attended or worked in the public education system. Others cited her lack of familiarity with a landmark law protecting the education needs of disabled children.     She was panned for a gaffe during her confirmation hearing, when she hedged on an answer about guns in schools by saying they might be needed in states like Wyoming to defend against ""potential grizzlies.""?DeVos' nomination drew above-average negative reactions from the public, with voters flooding Senate phone lines and email accounts in recent weeks. Sen. Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., said his office received 14,000 calls about DeVos. In addition to the entire Democratic caucus, two moderate Republicans, Sens. Susan Collins of Maine and Lisa Murkowski of Alaska announced they would not support DeVos. During a speech announcing her opposition, Collins said DeVos""?focus on charters and vouchers ""raises the question of whether or not she fully appreciates that the secretary of education's primary focus must be on helping states and communities, parents, teachers, school board members and administrators strengthen our public schools.""?Before the confirmation vote, the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee voted along party lines, 12-11, to refer DeVos""?nomination to the full Senate.

2,2017/2/7,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/melania-trump-white-house-millions-brand-45327337,Melania Trump Says White House Could Mean Millions for Brand,,"First lady Melania Trump has said little about what she intends to do with her prominent position. But in new court documents, her lawyers say that the ""multi-year term"" during which she ""is one of the most photographed women in the world"" could mean millions of dollars for her personal brand. While the new documents don't specifically mention her term as first lady, the unusual statement about her expected profits drew swift condemnation from ethics watchdogs as inappropriate profiteering from her high-profile position, which is typically centered on public service. The statement came Monday in a libel lawsuit the first lady re-filed in a state trial court in Manhattan. Trump has been suing the corporation that publishes the Daily Mail's website over a now-retracted report that claimed she once worked as an escort. In the filing Monday, Trump's lawyers argued that the report was not only false and libelous, but also damaged her ability to profit off her high profile and affected her business opportunities. Trump ""had the unique, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, as an extremely famous and well-known person, as well as a former professional model, brand spokesperson and successful businesswoman, to launch a broad-based commercial brand in multiple product categories, each of which could have garnered multi-million dollar business relationships for a multi-year term during which plaintiff is one of the most photographed women in the world,"" the lawsuit said. The products could have included apparel, accessories, jewelry, cosmetics, hair care and fragrance, among others, the suit says. The first lady is seeking compensatory and punitive damages of at least $150 million. Richard Painter, who advised former President George W. Bush on ethics, said the language in the lawsuit shows Melania Trump is engaging ""in an unprecedented, clear breach of rules about using her government position for private gain. This is a very serious situation where she says she intends to make a lot of money. That ought to be repudiated by the White House or investigated by Congress."" Painter is part of a group of attorneys suing the president for an alleged violation of a constitutional clause that prohibits presidents from receiving foreign gifts or payments. In response to questions from The Associated Press, Charles Harder, Melania Trump's attorney, said ""the first lady has no intention of using her position for profit and will not do so. It is not a possibility. Any statements to the contrary are being misinterpreted."" Harder did not respond to a follow-up question about what the lawsuit means by ""once-in-a-lifetime opportunity."" To Painter and others, there is no ambiguity. ""She's not talking about the future,"" Painter said. ""She's talking about earning money now."" Scott Amey, general counsel of the Washington watchdog Project on Government Oversight, said it is ""another example of the first family blurring the line between public service and private business interests."" Trump previously filed the lawsuit against Mail Media Inc. in Maryland, but a judge earlier this month ruled the case was filed in the wrong court. The lawsuit is now filed in New York, where the corporation has offices. Trump also had sued blogger Webster Tarpley for reporting the unsubstantiated rumors. Trump filed the lawsuit in Maryland after both Tarpley and the Daily Mail issued retractions. On Tuesday, Melania Trump's attorneys said they'd settled the Maryland case against Tarpley. ""Mr. Tarpley has issued the attached retraction and apology to Mrs. Trump and her family, and agreed to pay her a substantial sum as a settlement,"" Harder's office said in a statement. Melania Trump's previous work in marketing has drawn scrutiny before. On Inauguration Day, the official White House biography for Melania Trump originally included an explicit reference to her jewelry collection, which it noted was sold on the home-shopping channel QVC. By the next day, that bio had been edited and simplified to say that she had ""launched her own jewelry collection."" A spokeswoman for the first lady said the website was updated out of ""an abundance of caution"" and that the jewelry line is no longer available in any case. President Donald Trump continues to financially benefit from his global business empire, breaking from past practice. Previous presidents and their families have divested from business interests and placed their holdings in a blind trust, although there is no legal requirement to do so. Trump handed daily management of the real estate, property management and licensing to his adult sons and a longtime Trump Organization employee.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
3,2017/2/7,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/trump-fears-fraud-gop-eliminates-election-commission-45328264,"As Trump Fears Fraud, GOP Eliminates Election Commission",,"A House committee voted on Tuesday to eliminate an independent election commission charged with helping states improve their voting systems as President Donald Trump erroneously claims widespread voter fraud cost him the popular vote. The party-line vote came less than two days after Trump vowed to set up a White House commission helmed by Vice President Mike Pence to pursue his accusations of election fraud. ""We're going to look at it very, very carefully,"" Trump said of voter fraud in an interview with Fox News that aired Sunday. ""It has to do with the registration, and when you look at the registration and you see dead people that have voted."" Reports that Trump told congressional leaders in a meeting last month that 3 to 5 million ballots were cast illegally during the 2016 race were met with discomfort on Capitol Hill. While top Republicans have refused to disavow his charges of election fraud, they haven't pushed for action on the issue, which remains a low priority for congressional leadership. The vote in the House Administration Committee underscored, once again, the political differences between the Republican president and the party's rank-and-file. The GOP majority on the committee eliminated the Election Assistance Commission, which was created by Congress after the 2000 Florida recount to upgrade voting technology and provide election-related information to federal entities, state officials and election administrators. Republicans say the commission is a prime example of government waste. They've been introducing legislation to end the commission for years with little success. ""If we're looking at reducing the size of government this is a perfect example of something that can be eliminated,"" said Rep. Gregg Harper, the committee chairman. ""We don't need fluff."" Harper said he hadn't spoken to Trump about the legislation. ""He's certainly welcome to call me at any time,"" he said. The bill was opposed by committee Democrats and voting rights groups, who argued that the federal agency plays a vital role in protecting elections from hacking and other types of interference. ""At a time when the vast majority of the country's voting machines are outdated and in need of replacement, and after an election in which foreign criminals already tried to hack state voter registration systems, eliminating the EAC poses a risky and irresponsible threat to our election infrastructure,"" said Wendy Weiser, the democracy program director at the Brennan Center for Justice. The committee also voted to terminate the public financing system, which provides major party presidential nominees a lump sum grant of roughly $94.14 million in the general election. But by accepting the grant, a candidate may not raise any additional funds and is severely limited in how much of his own money he can give or lend to his campaign. President Barack Obama effectively ended the practice of candidates taking general election public financing in 2008, when he chose not to accept it. His Republican rival John McCain took the grant that year and was swamped by the Obama campaign's spending. Neither Hillary Clinton nor Trump accepted public financing this year. Money for the public financing of campaigns is collected through voluntary $3 checkoffs on taxpayers' returns. The checkoffs do not affect how much money a taxpayer owes. The legislation would devote $63 million of the available funds to pediatric cancer research. The remainder would be returned to the Treasury for deficit reduction. It is not clear if the full House will vote on the measures.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
4,2017/2/7,http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/appeals-court-decide-challenge-trumps-immigration-executive-order/story?id=45325524,Appeals Court to Decide on Challenge to Trump's Immigration Executive Order,,"This afternoon, three federal judges from the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals will hear oral arguments in the emergency legal challenge to President Trump's executive order that temporarily bars immigration and travel to the U.S. for people from seven Muslim-majority countries and for refugees. The hearing, which will be conducted over the phone at 3 p.m. Pacific time, will allow each side to give 30-minute arguments. The plaintiffs in this appeal, Washington and Minnesota, will state their case, as will the Department of Justice. The public can listen to the hearings live on the 9th Circuit website. The judges are expected to rule on the future of the executive order after hearing oral arguments. While their decision won't determine the constitutionality of Trump's immigration ban, it will determine whether the suspension of the executive order, ruled by U.S. District Court Judge James Robart, will remain. The two states have argued that Trump's order was likely to cause ""irreparable harm"" to businesses, schools, family relations and state residents' freedom to travel and is unconstitutional because it discriminates on the basis of religion. The Justice Department said the travel restrictions are a matter of national security and the administration was excluding people from countries with ties to terrorism, not people of a certain religion.     Today, Trump suggested that the legal battle between the two states and the Justice Department could make it all the way to the Supreme Court. ""We're going to take it through the system,"" said Trump. ""It's very important for the country, regardless of me or whoever succeeds at a later date."" On Capitol Hill today, Secretary of >Homeland Security John Kelly defended the immigration executive order, calling it ""lawful and constitutional."" Only a week old, the order has sparked protests and outcry across the country. The legal community has been grappling with the order, some travelers have been delayed, and others are wondering if they will be allowed previously approved entry into the United States. The order, called Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States, bars all people with immigrant and nonimmigrant visas from Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from coming to the U.S. for 90 days. It also prevents the entry of refugees from anywhere in the world for 120 days, with an indefinite ban on refugees from the war-torn country of Syria. The Monday after Trump signed his order, Washington state filed a legal challenge that was joined by Minnesota. Robart, an appointee of President George W. Bush, on Friday issued a temporary restraining order, which covers the entire U.S., blocking the travel ban. Trump immediately took issue with the move, tweeting on Saturday, ""The opinion of this so-called judge ... is ridiculous and will be overturned!"" On Saturday the Department of Justice, challenging Robart's ruling, turned to the powerful 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco to try to immediately lift the restraining order while the appeal was being considered. The appeals court denied the request. The outcome of today's hearing with the 9th Circuit could determine ""?at least temporarily ""?the fate of thousands of refugees, immigrants and travelers in the United States and abroad hoping to enter the U.S.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
5,2017/2/7,http://abcnews.go.com/US/23-states-winter-weather-alerts-us-braces-severe/story?id=45319196,At Least 4 Tornadoes Reported in Southeast Louisiana,,"At least four tornadoes touched down in Louisiana today, causing damage and injuring locals. Tornadoes were reported in New Orleans, Baton Rouge, Donaldsonville, Ponchatoula and Killian, according to ABC News meteorologist Melissa Griffin. Tornado watches were in effect for parts of Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama and the Florida panhandle. The tornado watch in Louisiana and Mississippi expired after 2 p.m., when the storms moved east, Griffin said. The tornado watch in Alabama and Florida is set to expire at 6 p.m. Severe storms are expected in cities such as Gulfport, Biloxi, Mobile and Pensacola. There could still be isolated and severe storms in North and South Carolina. As of Tuesday morning, at least 23 U.S. states were under winter weather alerts, and a tornado watch has been issued for parts of the Southeast as most of the country braces for severe weather this week. ""We are in a very active weather pattern all across the country, from California to New York,""?ABC News senior meteorologist Max Golembo said. An atmospheric river, which draws massive amounts of water vapor from the Pacific Ocean, has taken aim at California, where the National Weather Service has issued flash flood and flood watches through Friday.   Copious rainfall is in the forecast for the West Coast until the end of the week, potentially bringing floods, mudslides and debris flows. ABC News""?weather team predicts more than a half a foot of rain in Central to Northern California over the next several days. Additional rain is expected for Portland, Oregon, and Seattle. ""California will see waves of moisture on and off through Friday,""?Golembo said.   Meanwhile, thunderstorms and damaging winds are expected to rattle Southern states, from the Gulf Coast to the Ohio Valley. The National Weather System has issued a tornado watch for portions of southern Louisiana, southern Mississippi and other parts of the region's coast until 2 p.m. local time. ""severe storms are firing up already in Louisiana and Mississippi,""?Golembo said. ""damaging winds are the biggest threat this morning.""?  Northeastern states can expect to see rain, snow and ice this week, according to ABC News meteorologists. The first of two storms arrives today, bringing rain and ice for much of the region, with potential snowfall in Boston and other parts of New England. The icy weather moved through the Hudson Valley into southern New England this morning. By this afternoon, the snow and ice in Boston will transition to heavy rain, with some snow and ice lingering in New England and the upper Hudson Valley near Albany, New York.   ABC News meteorologists said a second storm will move into the Northeast on Thursday morning, bringing mostly snow to New York City and Boston. Heavy snowfall is in the forecast until Thursday afternoon. Some weather models are showing snow farther south in Philadelphia and Washington, D.C. ""This could be a plowed event for major Northeast cities,""?Golembo said. ""stay tuned. This is a changing forecast.""?

The attack took place in front of dozens of backpackers at a hostel in northern Queensland. Ayliffe-Chung was found dead at the scene. Jackson tried to stop the attack and was fatally wounded.

Last week, after Iran tested a ballistic missile, Trump tweeted that the country was ""playing with fire,"" saying they ""don't appreciate how 'kind' President (Barack) Obama was to them. Not me!"" Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who makes the final decisions on all major policies in Iran, appeared to respond to the tweet in a remarks carried by State TV. ""Why should we be thankful to the previous U.S. administration?"" he said. ""Because it imposed anti-Iranian sanctions? Because of the extremist Islamic State group? Setting the region on fire in Iraq and Syria?"" He went on to mock Trump, saying: ""We are thankful to Mr. Newcomer, of course, since he has shown the real face of the U.S. and proved what Iran has said for 38 years about the political, economic, social and moral corruption of the U.S. government."" He added that the Iranian people ""are not afraid of any threat."" Trump has repeatedly criticized the 2015 nuclear agreement between Iran, the U.S. and five other world powers, in which Tehran agreed to curb its uranium enrichment in exchange for the lifting of international sanctions, but he has not said what he plans to do about it. His administration said Iran was ""on notice"" over the missile test, and imposed new sanctions on more than two dozen Iranian companies and individuals. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, a moderate who has worked to improve relations with the West, said earlier Tuesday that the nuclear agreement could serve as a blueprint for resolving other Middle East disputes. As an example, he pointed to Russian-led negotiations in Kazakhstan aimed at firming up a shaky Syrian cease-fire and paving the way for the revival of peace talks to end that country's nearly six-year civil war. Iran and Russia are close allies of Syrian President Bashar Assad, while the U.S. and other Western countries support the rebels fighting to topple him.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

In Escambia County, Florida -- where uniformed and plain clothed officers are increasing patrols -- the sheriff's office on Monday called Boyette, 44, and Rice, 37, moving targets, saying they are believed to be moving through wooded areas and may be along the Florida and Alabama border. U.S. Marshals from across the country, along with bloodhounds and helicopters, are taking part in the search, officials said this morning. ""We have a killer in our midst,"" said Escambia County Sheriff David Morgan.     The first reported crime was on Jan. 31, in Santa Rosa County, Florida, when Alicia Greer, 30, and Jacqueline Moore, 39, were found shot to death at an inn, Morgan said.
